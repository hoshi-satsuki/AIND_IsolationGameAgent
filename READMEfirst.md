# Project Isolation Game Playing agent
In this project we construct a game playing agent that
plays isolation with knights. The algorithm uses Minimax,
alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening. Several heuristics
get tested against each other.  
For further details see README.md.  
This project has been part of the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree on Udacity.
